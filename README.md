Keeping in view of growing requirements of effective and efficient means for the convenience of the public in various sectors, with our knowledge of Python and SQL, in this project, we have tried to provide a simple solution for the entertainment sector.

Our project has the complete management solutions to provide a means of organising information related to films, television programs, home videos for easy reference by the user anytime, anywhere. Users can browse various movies, give ratings and create wish-lists. We have divided the program into small user defined functions to take care of all future upgrades and expansion.

Salient Features of the Project:

● User friendly menu driven options

● Exceptions used for creating non-existent csv files, SQL databases and tables and for
dealing with invalid usernames to avoid inconvenience to users

● Data Validation for usernames, passwords, ratings and other inputs to avoid
ambiguous/wrong/invalid data entry from the user.

● Various modes like admin-mode and user-mode with a log-in option.

● It ensures the satisfaction of the user through options to rate the movies, shows and
provides daily recommendations.
